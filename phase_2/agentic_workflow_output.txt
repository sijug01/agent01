Defining workflow steps from the workflow prompt
1. Develop an Email Ingestion System:
   - Integrate with email services via SMTP, IMAP, and RESTful APIs.
   - Retrieve and preprocess emails in real-time to extract metadata and content.

2. Implement a Message Classification Module:
   - Use LLM-based classifiers to analyze email content and determine intent and category.
   - Assign confidence scores for automated responses or manual handling decisions.

3. Integrate a Knowledge Base:
   - Implement a vector database for efficient storage and retrieval of organizational knowledge.
   - Continuously update the knowledge base with new information from resolved inquiries.

4. Deploy a Response Generation Engine:
   - Utilize a RAG system to generate contextually accurate responses.
   - Include an approval workflow for reviewing and editing automated responses.

5. Develop Routing Logic:
   - Create a rules-based engine to assign emails to appropriate SMEs based on content analysis.
   - Enable context-aware forwarding with relevant metadata and correspondence history.

6. Design a User Interface:
   - Develop a dashboard for monitoring system performance and metrics.
   - Provide a configuration panel for managing the knowledge base, routing rules, and system settings.
   - Implement manual override options for human intervention when necessary.

8. Document the deployment process and provide training for users on how to utilize the new system effectively.

***Executing step:***

  Develop Routing Logic: Create a rules-based engine to assign emails to appropriate SMEs based on content analysis. Enable context-aware forwarding with relevant metadata and correspondence history.

***Tasks:***

 Feature: Email Routing System

Description: This feature will involve developing a rules-based engine that can analyze the content of incoming emails and assign them to the appropriate Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). The system will enable context-aware forwarding by considering relevant metadata and correspondence history.

User Stories:
1. As a user, I want incoming emails to be automatically analyzed for content.
2. As a user, I want the system to assign emails to the most suitable SME based on the content analysis.
3. As a user, I want the system to consider metadata such as sender information and email subject for routing decisions.
4. As a user, I want the system to take into account the correspondence history with the sender for context-aware forwarding.
5. As a user, I want to be able to customize rules for email routing based on specific criteria.
6. As a user, I want to receive notifications or alerts for emails that require manual intervention or override of routing rules.
